# Project Name (Veya | Wedding Planner)

This project is an early-stage experiment focused on designing and building a **calm, decision-first dashboard** for tracking progress, readiness, and key actions around a single high-stakes goal or lifecycle (initially modeled around planning and preparation).

The emphasis at this stage is **structure, system design, and UX fundamentals**, not visual polish or feature completeness.

---

## Goals

- Design a clear, minimal dashboard that surfaces **what matters now**
- Reduce cognitive load by focusing on **signals, not noise**
- Explore modern React patterns (Server Components, Server Actions, optimistic UI)
- Build a scalable design system from first principles (CSS tokens, layout primitives)

---

## Non-Goals (for now)

This project intentionally does **not** aim to be:

- A task manager
- A collaboration tool
- A full analytics platform
- A generic CRUD dashboard
- A production-ready SaaS

Features that introduce unnecessary complexity are deferred by design.

---

## Current Stage

**Status:** Early / Foundations

What exists or is in progress:
- Global design system (colors, typography, spacing, layout tokens)
- Information architecture & page structure
- Dashboard concept and wireframe-level decisions
- Exploration of UX patterns (optimistic updates, async workflows)

What does *not* exist yet:
- Final UI
- Authentication flows
- Complete data models
- Mobile-responsive layouts
- Polished copy or branding

---

## Tech Stack (subject to change)

- Next.js (App Router)
- React 18/19 features
- Server Actions
- Supabase (planned for data & auth)
- CSS-first design system (no heavy UI framework at this stage)

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Clarity over completeness**
- **Decisions over data**
- **Structure before styling**
- **Opinionated defaults**
- **Progressive complexity**

If a feature does not meaningfully improve decision-making, it does not ship.

---

## Development Approach

The project is being built incrementally:

1. Design tokens & global CSS
2. Layout primitives
3. Page structure & data flow
4. Async UX patterns
5. Visual refinement (later)

This order is intentional.
